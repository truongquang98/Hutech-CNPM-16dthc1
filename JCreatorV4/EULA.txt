2. GENERAL 

This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and Xinox Software for the Xinox Software products identified above, which may include computer software and associated media, electronic documentation and printed materials ("The Software"). By installing, copying, distributing or otherwise using The Software you agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, you must not install, use or distribute The Software, and you must destroy all copies of The Software that you have. The Software is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The Software is licensed, not sold and always remains the property of Xinox Software. 

Xinox Software will supply the Licensee with a single copy of the Software and Documents in electronic format, using a distribution mechanism decided on by Xinox Software. Xinox Software also will additionally supply the Licensee with a serial number and registration key. The Licensee agrees to restrict distribution of the registration key only to staff members with a need to know for purposes of configuring the Software or recording registration information for the usual business records of the Licensee, and will make all reasonable efforts to prevent duplication and any form of publication of the registration material. 

If you have not paid the registration fee for the Software, you are hereby granted an evaluation license to use the Software as described in section 4.1.

3. LICENSE GRANT

Subject to the payment of the applicable license fees, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Xinox Software hereby grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Software and the accompanying documentation (the "Documentation"). Except as set forth below, you may only install one copy of the Software on one computer, workstation or other electronic device for which the Software was designed (each, a "Client Device"). If the Software is licensed as a suite or bundle with more than one specified Software product, this license applies to all such specified Software products, subject to any restrictions or usage terms specified on the applicable price list or product packaging that apply to any of such Software products individually.

(a) Use. The Software is licensed as a single product; more than one user may not use it on more than one Client Device or at a time, except as set forth in this Section 1. The Software is "in use" on a Client Device when it is loaded into the temporary memory (i.e., random-access memory or RAM) or installed into the permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device) of that Client Device. This license authorizes you to make one copy of the Software solely for backup or archival purposes, provided that the copy you make contains all of the Software's proprietary notices. 
(b) Multiple Client Devices. A licensed user is also granted a license to install the Software on more than one Client Device, for the sole use of that user. 
(c) Server-Mode. You may use the Software on a Client Device as a server ("Server") within a multi-user or networked environment, on a single physical site, ("Server-Mode") only if such use is permitted in the applicable price list or product packaging for the Software. A separate license is required for each Client Device or "seat" that may connect to the Server at any time, regardless of whether such licensed Client Devices or seats are concurrently connected to, accessing or using the Software. Use of software or hardware that reduces the number of Client Devices or seats directly accessing or utilizing the Software (e.g., "multiplexing" or "pooling" software or hardware) does not reduce the number of licenses required (i.e., the required number of licenses would equal the number of distinct inputs to the multiplexing or pooling software or hardware "front end"). If the number of Client Devices or seats that can connect to the Software can exceed the number of licenses you have obtained, then you must have a reasonable mechanism in place to ensure that your use of the Software does not exceed the use limits specified for the licenses you have obtained. This license authorizes you to make or download one copy of the Documentation for each Client Device or seat that is licensed, provided that each such copy contains all of the Documentation's proprietary notices. 
(d) Volume Licenses. If the Software is licensed with volume license terms specified in the applicable price list or product packaging for the Software, you may make, use and install as many additional copies of the Software on the number of Client Devices as the volume license authorizes. You must have a reasonable mechanism in place to ensure that the number of Client Devices on which the Software has been installed does not exceed the number of licenses you have obtained. This license authorizes you to make or download one copy of the Documentation for each additional copy authorized by the volume license, provided that each such copy contains all of the Documentation's proprietary notices.
(e) Site Licenses. If the Software is licensed with site license terms, you may make, use and install unlimited copies of the Software within the organization site. This excludes Client Devices outside the organization, such as the home-computers of the students and staff members. This license authorizes you to make or download one copy of the Documentation for each copy authorized by the site license, provided that each such copy contains all of the Documentation's proprietary notices.
